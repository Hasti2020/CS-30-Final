A checklist created for every element of the program that needs alpha testing.
(you can use your development plan and changelog to help you generate a list) 
Summary of the results of the alpha testing, along with a list of fixes to be made.

Alpha Testing Checklist:
- Exception Handling in the potion, battle, and character modules
- Maxima Potion timer and player's input overlap
- Stacking Maxima Potion
- High Score storing
- Stopping the game once player dies
- Increase attacks (Do they really work?)
- Dialogs (Make sure no grammar error, spelling mistakes, and on themed)
