'''
This module is in charge of the part in the game where the player battles 
enemies using spells, potions, and wands. It handles character health, damage, 
timers, and score updates. Classes include Player and Opponent, with support 
from external modules like spells, potions, and wand. Also the time library 
would be used to excecute the timer for the Maxima Potion and 
time.sleep() is to show the texts slowly to the console
