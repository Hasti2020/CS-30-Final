This is the main menu of our game, a game where the player will be emerged 
into the Wizarding world of Harry Potter. First they will recieve the letter
from Hogwarts. Then they will arrive to the Diagon Alley, where they will get
to collect all their school supplies, like books, wands, pets to get into the
school. When they actually get into Hogwarts, they will get to do a House Quiz
and be sorted into their house they score the most points on the quiz. In 
Hogwarts, the player would get to walk around, join different classes like
the potion and spell class, where they get to make/learn useful information
that will help them in their battle later on. Lastly, the ending is where the
player gets to enter the DiWizzard Tournament, where they will fight 3 
different randomized opponents, and if they survive, they would get to fight
with Lord Voldemort. And if they win that battle, they will be crowned the
hero of the wizaarding world!
