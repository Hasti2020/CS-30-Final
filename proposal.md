# Story line
We will create a Harry Potter themed game where the students would at first get to choose their wand, pets, potion and enter the triwizard tournament in Hogwarts. Where they will be fighting with randomized oponents, and would win if they sucessfuly defeated all their oponents and remain alive in the end with the highest score.

- list of all opponents with different strengths and they will be assigned randomly to the players. (random library)
- The opponents will be their own child classes, with the player being a parent classes
- Where the parent class would have a take_damage function, maybe heal
- The player classes would be the child to that parent class, containing fuctions like inflict_damage.
- The oppenent will be the child of the player class also having the same function as it. 

Wand Module:
- Each wand would be in a list and have a different power range, and each attack would be a random value within that range.
