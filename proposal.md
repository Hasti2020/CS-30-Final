# Storyline
We will create a Harry Potter-themed game where the students would at first get to choose their wand, pets, potion, and enter a Diwizzard Tournament in Hogwarts. They will be fighting with randomized opponents, and would win if they successfully defeated all their opponents and remained alive in the end.
Flow of the game:
- Hagrid invites the player to Hogwarts
- They'll first go to Diagon Alley, where they will be able to pick a wand, a pet, and school supplies
- They'll then go to Hogwarts
- They'll be assigned a house based on a short quiz
- They'll have the option to attend classes (potions, charms, transfiguration)
- They'll have class quizzes with questions to earn bonus points
- There will be hidden hints in those classes that can help in future battles
- They'll be invited to join the Diwizzard tournament at their own risk
- Three battles with random opponents, and if they survive,  
- They'll face the final boss, aka Voldemort, who showed up unexpectedly in the tournament.

# Need To Have List:
- 2 Maps for Diagon Alley and Hogwarts
- A house sorting Quiz

- Character Movement
- Randomized opponents to fight our character in the battles
- Have Voldemort as the final boss
- Stores player's high score in an external file for them to retry to get a higher one.
- An inventory of their wands, potions, and pets
- Each wand would be in a list and have a different power range, and each attack would be a random value within that range.

- A module for the battles
- A module for the player's inventory (maybe view_inventory or select classes?)

# Nice To Have List:  
- In the potion class, the player gets to learn the abilities of each potion that would come in handy in the battle (if they remember)
